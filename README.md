# GitOps repository

This repository is an integral part of the project which consists of 3 parts.

This is an operational resource, a gitops repository. Here are placed complete Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application after the CI cycle.
This resource should not be public. I have made it public for demonstration purposes.
